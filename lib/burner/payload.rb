module Burner
  # The input for all Job#perform methods.  The main notion of this object is its "value"
  # attribute.  This is dynamic and weak on purpose and is subject to whatever the Job#perform
  # methods decides it is.  This definitely adds an order-of-magnitude complexity to this whole
  # library and lifecycle, but I am not sure there is any other way around it: trying to build
  # a generic, open-ended object pipeline to serve almost any use case.
  #
  # The side_effects attribute can also be utilized as a way for jobs to emit any data in a more
  # structured/additive manner.  The initial use case for this was for Burner's core IO jobs to
  # report back the files it has written in a more structured data way (as opposed to simply
  # writing some information to the output.)
